1. Introduction

This Python script is designed to parse emails from a specified mailbox and extract information about companies with low wallet balances. It connects to an IMAP server using the provided credentials, searches for emails matching specific criteria, and extracts relevant data from the email subjects and bodies.

2. Dependencies

- `imaplib`: Library for accessing and manipulating mail using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).
- `email`: Provides tools for parsing and handling email messages.
- `email.header`: Allows decoding email headers.
- `datetime`: Provides functionality to work with dates and times.
- `re`: Module for regular expressions.
- `bs4` (Beautiful Soup): Library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

- Select Generate.
- The generated app password will be displayed. Copy it to a secure location, as you won't be able to see it again.

- **Search Criteria**: Emails are searched based on the sender's email address and within the specified date range.
- **Data Extraction**: The script extracts company names and wallet balances from email subjects and bodies.
- **Output**: The parsed data (company names and wallet balances) is sent to an excel file.
- **Logout**: Finally, the script logs out and closes the connection to the email server.

5. Usage
